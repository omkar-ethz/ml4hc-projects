# Project 1: Interpretable and Explainable Classification for Medical Data
## Running the code from the `part_1.ipynb` notebook:
- Create a new environment: `conda create -n part1 jupyter`
- Set up the environment according to the `requirements_part1.txt` file
- Go to the notebook and "Run All". (Since the dataset of part_1 is small, it is already present under the `data/` directory).
## Running the code from the `part_2.ipynb` notebook:
- Create a new environment: `conda create -n part2 jupyter`
- Make sure you set up the environment according to the `requirements_part2.txt` file
- Unzip the X-ray images dataset into the data folder

## Running the code from the `part_2_challenge.ipynb` notebook:
- Create a new environment: `conda create -n part2_challenge jupyter` or use a previously created one from part_2
- Make sure you set up the environment according to the `requirements_part2.txt` file
- Initialize the `path_data` variable with your path to the **chest_xray** folder (tip: search for the comment `# TO-DO: INSERT PATH TO DATA (saved in folder chest_xray) HERE`)
- Press "Run_All". 

After performing the above steps, the code should be able to run!
